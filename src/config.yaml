options:
  disable-mlock:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >-
      Set this option only if you are deploying to an environment that
      does not support the mlock(2) system call.

      When this option is set, vault will be unable to prevent secrets
      from being paged out, so use it with extreme caution.
  nagios_context:
    default: "juju"
    type: string
    description: |
      A string that will be prepended to instance name to set the host name
      in nagios. So for instance the hostname would be something like:
          juju-myservice-0
      If you're running multiple environments with the same services in them
      this allows you to differentiate between them.
  nagios_servicegroups:
    default: ""
    type: string
    description: |
      Comma separated list of nagios servicegroups for the service checks.
  ssl-cert:

      The SSL certificate, base64-encoded.
  ssl-chain:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The SSL chain certificate, base64-encoded.
  ssl-key:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The SSL key, base64-encoded.
  ssl-ca:
    type: string
    default: ""
    description: >-
      The SSL Root CA certificate, base64-encoded.
  vip:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      Virtual IP to use api traffic. You can provide up to two addresses
      configured on the access or external bindings. If neither binding
      is used then you can only provide one address that must be configured
      on the default space. Mutually exclusive with the dns-ha-access-record
      config option or lb-provider relation.
  channel:
    type: string
    default: 1.8/stable
    description: >-
      The snap channel to install from.
      WARNING: Changing this value will cause ALL the vault units to become
      sealed, due to the snap refresh and the service being restarted on each
      unit.
  dns-ha-access-record:
    type: string
    default:
    description: |
      DNS record to use for DNS HA with MAAS. Mutually exclusive with the
      vip config option or lb-provider relation.
  totally-unsecure-auto-unlock:

    default: false
    description: >-
      FOR TESTING ONLY. Initialise vault after deployment and store the keys
      locally. Locally stored material can be displayed with:
          juju run --unit vault/0 leader-get
  auto-generate-root-ca-cert:
    type: boolean
    default: false
    description: >-
      Once unsealed, automatically generate a self-signed root CA rather
      than waiting for an action to be called to either generate one or
      process a signing request to act as an intermediary CA.  Note that
      this will use all default values for the root CA cert.  If you want
      to adjust those values, you should use the generate-root-ca action
      instead.
  hostname:
    type: string
    default:
    description: >-
      Hostname to be used for the API URL. This hostname should exist as a DNS
      record and be resolvable by the charms that will consume the relation 
      with vault.
  max-ttl:
    type: string
    default: '87600h'
    description: >-
      Max allowed TTL to use when generating certs (must be greater than the
